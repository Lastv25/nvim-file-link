# nvim-file-link

The purpose of this project is to learn a little bit of lua and a little bit of neovim's internals.

I hope to have something similar to obsidians and dendrons note linking capabilities (but really less powerful) to be able to take notes with the **Zettelkasten** method of note taking.

Cheers ^^.
